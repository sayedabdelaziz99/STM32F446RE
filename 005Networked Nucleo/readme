Networked Nucleo: Sensor Monitoring, Actuation and logging via CAN Bus.
in this project, one board is connected to an ultrasonic sensor and sends the ditance measures in a cyclic pattern to the other board via CAN Bus
the other board is connected to an RTC, with each mailbox received via the can bus...the frequency at which the LED is being toggled is increased 
with the decrease in distance.
An RTC is connected to the board over I2C bus, and with each mailbox received the timer at which it is received gets measured and printed over
USART
A python script is made to open the COM port 2 and logg the data in an SCV file
